            <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, formerly known as the Victoria Terminus is the headquarters of

                Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and traditional Mughal buildings between the years 
                1878-1888 and gave Bombay the face of being the International Mercantile Port of India. In some ways,
                 the plan of the terminal though it has Italian and Victorian-era elements reminds us of the Indian
                  palace architecture and is an excellent example of the blending of an indigenous and western style 
                  of art. Due to several reasons such as pollution, traffic, construction work, etc., there have been 
                  reports of damages to this site. More work needs to be done to ensure the preservation of this
                   heritage site.
